# dwm-setup A simple script to setup dwm on Arch linux
## A setup script that installs everything you need to use my config of dwm (including dwm itself)

This is a shell script for setting up dwm to my liking.
It installs some programs like st,slstatus,flameshot and of course dwm.
It uses a rice that has been set up to my liking, you can probably adapt to any other rice. 

* Uses Catpuccin
* Installs needed programs
* Can set up bluetooth
