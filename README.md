# dwm-setup
This is my script that sets up dwm to my liking (on arch)

After you run this script, and go into dwm, you should open lxappearance and change the icon theme to papirus, gtk theme to dracula
and the cursor theme to layan

Add any lines you want to the .xprofile file, I added nitrogen --restore as a baseline,
If you want you can edit slstatus

the most important keybindings are 
meta_p == dmenu
meta_shift_c == close program

for the rest you can check out the config
