# dwm-setup

DONT RUN THIS AS ROOT!
This is my script that sets up dwm to my liking (on arch)

After you run this script, and go into dwm, you should open lxappearance and change the icon theme to papirus, gtk theme to dracula
and the cursor theme to layan

Add any lines you want to the .xprofile file, I added feh picom slstatus and polkit-gnome as a baseline,

the most important keybindings are 
meta_p == dmenu
meta_shift_c == close program
(will make a spreadsheet)

for the rest you can check out the config
